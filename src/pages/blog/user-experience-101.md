### "User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users."

“User Experience Design” is often used interchangeably with terms such as “User Interface Design” and “Usability”. However, while usability and user interface (UI) design are important aspects of UX design, they are subsets of it – UX design covers a vast array of other areas, too.

A UX designer is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. It is a story that begins before the device is even in the user’s hands, therefore some key notes need to be considered to reach good User Experience Design.

### 1. Affordance

Affordances refer to the perceived and actual properties of the things, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how things could possibly be used. If you look at your smart phone we see all sorts of features for example, buttons, buttons are for pressing, the idea is that the affordance of the thought is to press.

### 2. Signifiers

Where as affordances tell us what actions are possible signifiers tell us where that action should take place. If you look at the screen of your smartphone, it has all sort of affordances that can be related to the gestures you make. You can tap, you can pan, you can stretch, you can flip the screen. But now imagine that you are bound to send a text, the digital keyboard appears and the letters signify where you must tap to activate those letters.

### 3. Feedback

The third design feature of usable design is feedback. Feedback requires sending back user information about what system input has occurred. It communicates the result of an action. In our example of texting the feedback mechanism is that the letter that we press appears in the text box, letting us know that we pressed the desired key. We've all experienced changing phones, and somehow not being able to press the correct key. When we see the wrong letter in the text box, it gives us feedback that we've entered the wrong, that we've pressed the wrong key.

User interaction is an essential part of the user experience design process. Every time you interact with a user, you have access to precious information. We can only design useful and usable systems if we have good understanding of the individuals, and how they currently complete a given task. We gather this data during the user interaction sessions. 

The user engagement process has three parts,

1. The introduction
2. The interaction and
3. The closing.

First, you want to provide a brief overview. Let the user know what the goals are for the session. Ask them for their frank opinion. Let them know that there are no right or wrong answers and they should simply give you whatever feedback comes to mind. Explain that the interaction is confidential. You will not refer to any personal information they provide.

### 1. The Introduction

During the introduction, explain to the user that their participation is completely voluntary. That they are free to stop participating at any time. If they wish to stop participating, this will not negatively affect their relationship with your company or institution. This part is important to let the user feel at ease and unconstrained about the fact that you may be representing an entity that has a high profile in their community. This goes back to to that user experience and to that group or that society layer. During the introduction, you should keep the tone relaxed, but professional. This will signal to the user that you mean business and that you want to accomplish the goals that you set out in the introduction.

### 2. The Interaction

   During the interaction, it is also important for you to provide neutral feedback. Your demeanor should be positive, but in no way encourage or sensor the information that is being provided. During the introduction, if the format permits, encourage elaboration of unexpected or interesting information. During the session, keep control of the interaction. If the user has gone on a tangent or if you have gotten enough information on a given topic, steer the conversation back on track. Maintaining a respectful tone tells them that this was very helpful and that there are other items to cover during the time that you have left.

### 3. The Closing

   At the end of the session, remind them about the goals of the interaction and what you plan to do with their data. Ask if they have anything else to add. This part of the interaction is also called the debriefing and is just as important, as the rest of the engagement process. It allows you to get any last minute thoughts the user might have or answer any questions. It is also a final opportunity for you to build rapport with them and establish a sense that you are a professional. This is paramount, because you are an ambassador not just for the company or institution you represent, but also for the field.
